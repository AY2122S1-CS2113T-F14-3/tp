# CLI.ckFit User Guide

## Introduction
CLI.ckFit is a desktop-based fitness app which be accessed easily via CLI. CLI.ckFit allows you to input your calories, 
weight, foods, and workouts throughout the day. It also allows you to save your data and view it whenever you wish to. 
It also comes with a BMI and recommended caloric intake calculator which can give you an idea of your current fitness 
level. You can also schedule a variety of workouts such as running, cycling, gym etc. It is suitable for students 
staying on campus, especially existing people already involved in some level of exercise, such as casual gym goers or 
even student athletes. Prior knowledge in fitness and gym-related terminologies is beneficial, but not necessary.

## Motivations
University students staying on-campus have always found it difficult to juggle their hall activities, academic workload, 
and social activities. This makes it difficult for them to track their health & fitness. Furthermore, most students 
donâ€™t want to budget for a fitness app which may be inconvenient to access. Lastly, one's foray into serious fitness may 
be a daunting and a confusing process. The abundance of apps in the market that each provide different services can 
exacerbate this issue.

## Quick Start
1. The BMI calculator and recommended caloric intake calculator gives the user an idea of where his current fitness 
level stands. Users can also choose to skip using the calculators by entering the appropriate keystrokes.
2. The user can then access the calorie manager to track their caloric intake, while also using the workout schedule manager
to track the calories burned.
3. Workout schedule manager also allows the user to schedule future workouts
4. For the long term outlook, weight tracker lets the user monitor his weight over the length of usage of CLI.ckFit as an 
indicator of the user's progress

## Technical Start Up
1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `CLI.ckFit` from [here](http://link.to/duke).
3. Go to the folder you saved the CLIckFit.jar file and note the absolute file path.
4. If you are using Windows, open up a Command prompt terminal cmd.exe or powershell.exe and for
   Mac and Linux users, do the same with the terminal of your respective systems.
5. Navigate to the folder where the CLIckFit.jar file is stored.
6. Execute java -jar CLIckFit.jar in the terminal, and the application will start running.

### What is a rep?

A rep is short for repetitions. Repetitions define the number of times
to perform an exercise. For example if you do 12 squats, then stop, the
12 squats you perform are considered 12 repetitions.

### What is a set?

Sets refer to how many times you will repeat that exercise for the set
number of repetitions. For example, you do 12 squats and rest. Then
you do another 12 squats, rest, and then another 12. You have now
completed three sets of 12 reps.
