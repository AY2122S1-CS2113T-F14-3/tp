# CLI.ckFit User Guide

## Introduction

CLI.ckFit is a desktop-based fitness app which can be accessed easily via CLI. CLI.ckFit allows you to input your calories, 

weight, foods, and workouts throughout the day. It also allows you to save your data and view it whenever you wish to. 

It also comes with a BMI and recommended caloric intake calculator which can give you an idea of your current fitness 

level. You can also schedule a variety of workouts such as running, cycling, gym etc. It is suitable for students 

staying on campus, especially existing people already involved in some level of exercise, such as casual gym goers or 

even student athletes. Prior knowledge in fitness and gym-related terminologies is beneficial, but not necessary.

## Motivations

University students staying on-campus have always found it difficult to juggle their hall activities, academic workload, 

and social activities. This makes it difficult for them to track their health & fitness. Furthermore, most students 

donâ€™t want to budget for a fitness app which may be inconvenient to access. Lastly, one's foray into serious fitness may 

be a daunting and a confusing process. The abundance of apps in the market that each provide different services can 

exacerbate this issue.

## Quick Start

1. The BMI calculator and recommended caloric intake calculator gives the user an idea of where his current fitness 

level stands. Users can also choose to skip using the calculators by entering the appropriate keystrokes.

* *NOTE* : Please follow _**exactly**_ the explicitly _**required**_ input formats for answering the calculator 

questions. Any deviating inputs will 

result in the question being repeated so that the user is able to know exactly what inputs and formats are needed by the 

calculator to calculate BMI and recommended daily caloric intake.

2. The user can then access the calorie manager to track their caloric intake, while also using the workout schedule manager

to track the calories burned.

3. Workout schedule manager also allows the user to schedule future workouts

4. For the long term outlook, weight tracker lets the user monitor his weight over the length of usage of CLI.ckFit as an 

indicator of the user's progress

## Technical Start Up

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.

2. Download the latest version of `CLI.ckFit` from [here](http://link.to/duke).

3. Go to the folder you saved the `CLIckFit.jar` file and note the absolute file path.

4. If you are using Windows, open up a Command prompt terminal cmd.exe or powershell.exe and for

   Mac and Linux users, do the same with the terminal of your respective systems.

5. Navigate to the folder where the `CLIckFit.jar` file is stored.

6. Execute `java -jar CLIckFit.jar` in the terminal, and the application will start running.

## Common Terminologies and Definitions

* Calories are in kcal

* Weight is in kg

* Height is in cm

* Volume is in ml

* Date is in DD/MM/YYYY (e.g. 26/10/2021)

* Time is in HH:MM (e.g. 23:59)

### What is a rep?

A rep is short for repetitions. Repetitions define the number of times

to perform an exercise. For example if you do 12 squats, then stop, the

12 squats you perform are considered 12 repetitions.

### What is a set?

Sets refer to how many times you will repeat that exercise for the set

number of repetitions. For example, you do 12 squats and rest. Then

you do another 12 squats, rest, and then another 12. You have now

completed three sets of 12 reps.

## Known limitations

* CLI.ckFit may not handle illogical inputs correctly due to limitations of data types. For instance, if you enter an

overly large and nonsensical integer value for calories such as `2147483647` there may be overflow during computation. 

  E.g., when calculating total calories, summation may result in an overflow, producing negative calories. 
  
* Separators such as the date separator `/d`, time separator `/t`, calorie separator `/c`, volume separator `/v` and 

  activity separator `/a` should be entered in the **same order** as shown in their respective command formats. 

  CLI.ckFit **does not** actively support the shuffling of separators when taking user input. 
  
* The separators as shown in the command format should be input **once**. Typing multiple identical separators 

  unnecessarily *may* cause incorrect parsing of user input. 
  
* To ensure correct processing of user inputs you should only enter the **necessary** number of arguments. 

  For instance if you want to add a meal of `300` calories, only enter a **single** integer for your calories.

  E.g., enter `/c 300` instead of something like `/c 300 20 10`. The same applies to other arguments like date and time.
  
* Scheduled workouts with the same activity breakdowns in a different order **are not** considered duplicated

  in the current version of CLI.ckFit. If multiple activities with the same name are input in the same activity 

  breakdown, only the activity quantifier of the latest activity will be taken. This is due to limitations based

  on the choice usage of HashMaps in implementation.
  
* The current version CLI.ckFit only supports 3 types of distance based activities, 

  namely swimming, running and cycling. **ALL** other activities are assumed to be sets/repetitions based. 

## Important FAQs

* In order to load the data of your previous session, the user *MUST* press "enter" when prompted with the following 

question: 

`Would you like to load up the records of your fitness journey?

Key in 'y' to skip or press enter to load data from your previous session

Note: Keying in 'y' to skip this prompt will result in the previous session's databeing deleted!`
